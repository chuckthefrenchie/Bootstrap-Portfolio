            <p> My name in Daria. I was born in Siberia (yes it is very cold in there, it is about -25-30F in winter). I lived in the north of China for awhile, and then went to college in Russian Far East( !Fun fact! my school's campus is on an island, and there is nothing else besides the campus on this island). I lived in Shanghai for about year and a half, and was an exchange student at Fudan university. I have a degree in Internation Relations and Diplomacy. I moved to US at the end of 2015, and studied Business and Accounting in UCLA Extension. Right now I work for an accounting firm in Westwood. We do business management, accounting, bokkeeping, and taxes. I have amazing co-workers but accounting was never my passion so hopefully after the Bootcamp I will be able to find a job thta I will be more passionate about. </p>
